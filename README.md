### Hi there! Thank you for visiting my repository.



The project we worked on was to identify market trends in frequently purchased products based on circumstances. For example, which products are frequently purchased during holidays? We collaborated to produce a dashboard as the final output of the project.



What did we do for this project?

* Develop a plan using Trello before starting the project.
* Conduct data crawling using Python for 1-2 months.
* Create database tables based on the data obtained.
* Re-manage the collected data, including data cleaning and sampling using SSMS.
* Connect the cleaned data to Power BI.



At the time, we used Excel as our backup data storage. It was the best application for sending data to other roles for easy viewing.



Thank You!
